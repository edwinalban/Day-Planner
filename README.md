# Day-Planner
Business Hours Day Planner

## Description

I built this project for the purpose of practicing using Bootstrap, creating/manipulating elements in the DOM via JQuery, using the dayjs()method, and saving/updating elements based on user inputs. This project is focused primarily on the following:
Styling elements for responsive design via Bootstrap.
Creating elements in the DOM via JQuery.
Appending elements to divs once created via JQuery.
Using Event Listeners to run functions when events occur.
Using the dayjs() method.
Adding styling to elements with conditional statements.
Saving/accessing updates to Local Storage

## Usage

The project can be used to practice styling pages via Bootstrap, and using JQuery for traversing the DOM, selecting elements in the DOM for manipulation, adding Event Listeners (specifically "click" events), running functions as a result of user clicks, setting strings to local storage and retrieving them as objects to be displayed in the viewport.
